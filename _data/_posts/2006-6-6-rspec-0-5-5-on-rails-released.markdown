title: RSpec 0.5.5 on Rails released
---
<p>Hey, cool. I've just found an email dropping in my inbox that announces the 
release of RSpec 0.5.5. on Rails.</p>

<p>When I checked the last time, there's been a short note on the <a 
href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/tools/rails.html">"Tools: RSpec on Rails"</a> 
page on RSpec's project page saying something like "Yes, there's an 
experimental extension in SVN and if you feel really adventurous you may check 
it out." or so.</p>

<p>So I did, of course :) But unfortunately I haven't got anywhere with it - 
the specs just haven't been executed and from a quick look into the code I 
haven't been able to tackle anything.</p>

<p>There's been some <a 
href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/rspec-devel/2006-June/000099.html">discussion</a> 
on the RSpec dev mailinglist since talking about the best way to integrate 
Rails support (i.e. as a plugin, gem, ...) recently and I'm totally excited to 
read that there's a release within <em>less than a week</em> now.</p>

<p>In the meantime there's also an intro on the RSpec on Rails page linked 
above covering the installation process, howto run specs, naming conventions 
and each one example for usage with Rails models and controllers.</p>

<p>Honestly. I can't wait to check this stuff out.</p>
