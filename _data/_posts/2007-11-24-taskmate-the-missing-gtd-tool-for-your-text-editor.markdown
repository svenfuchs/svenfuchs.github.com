title: "Taskmate ... the missing GTD tool for your editor: now out!"
---
<p>Taskmate is currently available as a <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="TextMate â€” The Missing Editor for Mac OS X">TextMate</a> bundle only. But as it's a pure Ruby implementation it will as well be capable to pimp up any other scriptable editor. As I'm currently using (almost) only TextMate I don't want to integrate Taskmate with other editors myself. But if you want to give it a try, I'll happily help you with that.</p>

<p>I highly appreciate suggestions, feedback, criticism ... and of course help and participation.</p>

<p>By the way the TextMate integration of this bundle is based on <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/08/tasks-bundle" title="Tasks bundle for TextMate &ndash;  The Pug Automatic">Henrik's bundle</a> which was inspired by <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper" title="Taskpaper">Taskpaper by Jesse Grosjean</a>. Therefor the same licensing applies to it, i.e. you are free to modify and redistribute it non-commercially, though I would appreciate due credit.</p>

<p>Go ahead and <a href="http://www.artweb-design.de/projects/taskmate" title="Taskmate ... get more things done with your editor! - artweb design">try it out</a>! It's cool :-)</p>
