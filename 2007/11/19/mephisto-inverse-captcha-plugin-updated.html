<p>Just a short note for those of you who are using my <a href='/projects/mephisto-plugin-inverse-captcha-for-comments-anti-spam' title='Mephisto Plugin: Inverse Captcha for Comments (anti-spam)'>Mephisto Inverse Captcha</a> plugin: </p><p>I've recieved some feedback that the way the plugin was implemented apperently caused problems in fcgi environments. I've simplified the plugin loading quite a bit and now it seems to work fine.</p><p>I've got it running here on my own blog, too, with Rails 2.0PR and Mephisto rev2983 and it continues to work like a charm :) Actually, I have <b>no</b> spam comments thanks to it.</p><p>If you further encounter any problems please let me know :)</p>
