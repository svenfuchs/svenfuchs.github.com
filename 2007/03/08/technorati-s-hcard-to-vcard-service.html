<p>What this service does is that it converts my hCard to a vCard and download it to the user, nothing less, nothing more. After the download is finished the addressbook opens and the vCard is added to my contacts. (At least, that&#8217;s what happening on my Mac. I believe, on other OS something equivalent will happen, does it?)</p>

<p>To &#8220;install&#8221; this nifty thingy you simply put a plain HTML link to <a href='http://feeds.technorati.com/contacts/referrer'>this URL</a> onto a page that includes a hCard. When clicked, Technorati will go and look at the referring page, find the hCard, convert it to a vCard and return it to the user.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that just beautiful?</p>

<p>Painless plain simple distributed usefulness.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s a fantastic example of what microformats are good for.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way. Of course there are <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=hcard%20creator'>several tools</a> to create the hCard markup as well. For example there&#8217;s one directly on the <a href='http://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator'>microformats homepage</a>. Also, be sure to have a look <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/cgriego/283178092/'>at this one</a> :)</p>
