      <h1>Using a self join to select the rows with the maxium values per group</h1>
      <p>Of course there's more in these tables but here are the relevant
columns:</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE article (
  id int(10) auto_increment,
  location_id int(10),
  modified timestamp
)
CREATE TABLE location (
  id int(10) auto_increment,
  type varchar(10)
)
</pre>

<p>Now, I'd like to select all article rows with the newest modified timestamp
per blog and sort the results by the modified value. Also I want to exclude
just some of the blogs which I already know by their primary key id.</p>

<p>Simple, isn't it? I was *sure* that it's possible to just add a GROUP BY
clause on the articles location_id, sort them by modified and that's it.  The
exclusion of the blogs would be done by a simple, implicit JOIN.</p>

<pre>
SELECT article.*
FROM articles, location
WHERE location.id NOT IN (1)
GROUP BY article.location_id
ORDER BY article.modified
</pre>

<p>But I got wrong results. I set up two tables with test data because at
thought, I'd probably expect the wrong results. I threw 4 articles in the
articles table and 3 blogs in the locations table. I.e. one blog had two
articles, two blogs had one article.</p>

<p>Again, I got the wrong results. The query above selected the *older*
article from the both belonging to the same blog, instead of the newer one.
Both of the other articles where present in the results.</p>

<p>What the heck is going on here?</p>

<p>Obviously the ORDER statement applies to the selection *after* the GROUP
clause has been applied to the data. Because in the "natural order" of MySQL
ISAM Tables older rows will oftenly (not always) be selected first, the GROUP
clause first selects the older article row and *then* sorts all selected
rows.</p>

<p>That's been kind of new to me. I've always thought it works the other ways
around. I asked Google about "group by order by mysql" but found nothing
particular illuminating about this.</p>

<p>After some time of playing around with this, looking for alternatives and
doing a considerable amount of trial-and-error variations ... I've yet found
nothing and already prepared to throw that stuff aside, go ahead and do an
expensive</p>

<pre>
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tmp ... TYPE = HEAP
SELECT INTO tmp ...
SELECT FROM tmp ...
</pre>

<p>thing which I wouldn't like.</p>

<p>More or less by accident I found this page in the (not-really-that-concise)
<a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/example-maximum-column-group-row.html">MySQL
3.0/4.0 manual</a></p>

<p>The docs themselve tell you that something like this is only possible with
subselects which the database doesn't support (MySQL 4.0).</p>

<p>But hidden in the user comments there's this helpful tip from Csaba
Gabor:</p>

<p>"To find the most recent entry (the entry with the highest Id) for each
Item, where the Item does not currently have a Deleted status, we could
use:"</p>

<pre>
SELECT t1.*
FROM Tracker AS t1 LEFT JOIN Tracker AS t2
ON t1.Item=t2.Item AND t1.Id &lt; t2.Id
WHERE t2.Id IS NULL AND t1.Status!='Deleted'
</pre>

<p>... which set me on track again.</p>

<p>After some tweaking around, I found this one to be working in my case:</p>

<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT article.*
FROM article, location as l
LEFT JOIN article AS a2
ON article.locationID = a2.locationID
  AND article.modified &lt; a2.modified
  AND article.locationID = l.id
WHERE a2.modified IS NULL
  AND article.locationID = l.id
  AND l.type = 'blog'
  AND l.parentID NOT IN (1)
</pre>

<p>Now, I'll have to annihilate some pizzas and revel :)</p>
