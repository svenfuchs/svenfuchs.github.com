      <h1>First lessons learned: feedback about folksr</h1>
      <h2>Visible trackback links/URLs</h2>

<p>Huh! I've totally missed that there are several blogging engines out there
that require the user to <em>manually enter</em> trackback URLs. I'm that used
to this RDF autodiscovery stuff that this simply hadn't occured to me.</p>

<p>I'll add the trackback URL in a visible form to the voteoption details
pages of course.</p>

<h2>Ping webbugs</h2>

<p>Using the webbug to send a "digg this!" signal the application works but it
seems to be a bit contra-intuitive and probably unreliable approach.
Especially there's no way to provide feedback to the user like displaying a
success or error message. When something goes wrong, I folksr can not inform
the user about the problem or even suppose to change anything.</p>

<p>This makes me think I should definitely add a "digg this URL" form to the
application.</p>

<p>I first thought that the webbug way is far better in terms of usability
because I can theoretically provide a working HTML snippet which includes the
webbug and just needs to be pastet into some statical webpage. When this works
it's <em>two</em> steps (get the snippet, publish it) to get a vote in. Using
an additional "digg me" form would require the user to understand and
undertake <em>three</em> steps.</p>

<p>I think both approaches aren't mutually exclusive. So I'll add that form to
the existing behaviour next. But I'm not quite sure if the webbug approach can
be made reliable at all in the end.</p>

<h2>Identity</h2>

<p>I'm wondering what the best approach could be to restrict unique votes from
being pulled from different URLs. Blogs often display the same article with
different URLs (e.g. once on the blog's index page, the article's details
page, probably in the archives, categories, tags, ...).</p>

<p>Without further any measurements the same voteFor link would thus be found
and counted multiple times. Although this is mostly problematic with the
webbug approach and not so with the trackback mechanism of course.</p>

<p>Probably it's a good idea to allow the "owner" of a voting to require users
to somehow add a <a href="http://microid.org">microID</a> for the URL that
contains the vote?</p>

<h2>Usability</h2>

<p>Copying a link is not the easiest thing to do.</p>

<p>I've been watching somebody copying the link and pasting it directly into
one of those HTML Wysiwyg textarea replacments. Of course what he really
wanted is to paste it into the source-area of this tool.</p>
