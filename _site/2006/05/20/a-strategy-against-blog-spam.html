      <h1>Doable strategies against blog spam?</h1>
      <p>In the Typo admin area there's some "blacklist" option in the admin
interface, which claims to compare the users IP address to "local and remote
blacklists". The interface explains this as "Good defense against spam
bots."</p>

<p>Also you're recommended to *not* "allow non-ajax comments" which means that
comments will only accepted when send via Ajax (which most spammers don't seem
to be capable of).</p>

<p>Don't know about the blacklist option yet. I think I'll read up the code.
But I wonder why there's any need of the non-ajax comments option at all when
the IP comparsion really does it's job well.</p>

<p>While I've been thinking about this someone dropped an annoucement for a
Rails <a
href="http://cuttingtheredtape.blogspot.com/2006/05/actsasclassifiable.html">act_as_classifiable
plugin</a> to the RoR Mailinglist.</p>

<p>Hmmm. I wonder if there's been any attemp to accomplish something like
this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manually confirmed Typo blogs build up a "trusted blogs net" featuring a
distributed notification service about obvious spam requests. By obvious I
mean things like requests to Wordpress or other missing files on a Typo blog
or manually moderated comments.  When there's any such request on any Typo
blog, it will be made visible to all other Typo installations by distributing
it somehow (either through a central server or some kind of peer-to-peer
approach).</li>
<li>Each HTTP request will be analysed (i.e. "learned") as a whole (like <a
href="http://www.homelandstupidity.us/software/bad-behavior/">Bad
Behaviour</a> does it) through a Bayesian filter as "bad/spam" so that each
blog acts as a user to the Bayesian knowledge of the Typo blog net as a
whole.</li>
<li>This knowledge will be published back to the blogs so that each blog can
decide on additional measurements - like actually blocking the whole request
even for GET with a 412 error ("you're not allowed to read my blog.") when a
Request fails a local Baysian test.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way the following conditions would trigger whole HTTP Requests to be
marked/learned as "bad".</p>

<ul>
<li>it comes from an IP address known as a spammer by a remote blacklist</li>
<li>it has been moderated manually as spam</li>
</ul>

<p>HTTP Requests that come from IP addresses that are used by clients who
occasionally log in will be learned as "good".</p>

<p>This approach could also be used to greatly enhance a comment moderation
queue I think. Depending on the results of the Bayesian analysis the notification
mails could include a marker in the subject line indicating that the system
requires human feedback for this comment. Clicking on a given URL in the mail
would learn/unlearn the comment as good/bad. Comments that have been
recognized as "good" could immidiately be published.</p>

<p>Newly "learned" spam sources could be published to services like <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, <a href="http://www.surbl.org/">SURBL</a> or <a href="http://www.dnsbl.org/">DNSBL</a>.</p>

<p>Also there could be an additional interface to allow for complaints when
your comment has been treated as "bad" by the system.</p>


<p>Another thought:</p>

<p>I don't know enough about how the majority of spam bots work but I assume
that they're using some "fire and forget" strategy - by just issuing the POST
request to several known "candidate" URLs.</p>

<p>If so, this would allow for a very basic additional measurement - simply
add some kind of "please confirm your comment" page or (in case of Ajax being
used) alert box. Someone who just "fires-and-forgets" would fail this
handshake.</p>

<p>If not so, this on the other hand would allow to send the spammer to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_%28computing%29">honeypot</a>
which could make him wait half an hour or so to complete the request and
additionally logging as much of information as possible. (I've read about 1&1
having been asked to provide their logs to a lawsuit against a spammer but
can't remember the details.)</p>
