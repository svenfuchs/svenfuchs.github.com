<p>Ok, I admit it took me a while to figure out how to run a PHPUnit2 testcase via http rather than cli on a Windows box.</p><p>First thing I needed to understand is that PHPUnit2_Util_Printer::__construct() sets 
fopen('php://stdout', 'r'); as output stream by default. This won't output anything, 
so one has to advise the printer to use php://output.</p><p>Next thing was that I started the TestRunner by run(). Wrong way ... this instantiated
a new PHPUnit2_TextUI_TestRunner object and my output stream was send to nirvana.</p><p>The following works though:</p><pre>
$suite = new PHPUnit2_Framework_TestSuite();
$suite->addTestSuite(new ReflectionClass('MyTestCase'));
$runner = new PHPUnit2_TextUI_TestRunner();
$printer = new PHPUnit2_TextUI_ResultPrinter('php://output');
$runner->setPrinter($printer);
echo '&lt;pre>';
$result = $runner->doRun($suite);
</pre><p>And don't tell me to rtfm. I've found no docs on this. Nothing. I don't think there are any. :(</p>
