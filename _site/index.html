            When it comes to I18n one of the questions I get asked most often is how to organize translation keys. So I thought I&#8217;d write down how we&#8217;re doing it at work, and thus adva-cms2.

DRY does not apply to L10n

Before I get into this let me (once again) explain why DRY doesn&#8217;t apply to L10n though because that&#8217;s the reason why we allow for those deeply nested keys and namespaces in I18n.

Here&#8217;s a slide from my Anatomy of Ruby I18n talk at Euruko 2010:

            I&#8217;ve had this idea to record calls to the database connection for replaying &#8220;real&#8221; results later on a while ago. I&#8217;ve now found a few hours of time on the train and tried it out.

tl&#8217;dr: It doesn&#8217;t seem worth the effort. There&#8217;s no performance gain so far.

Here&#8217;s what I found:

            So, I&#8217;ve started playing with the idea of a distributed build server tool once again in last year&#8217;s December &#8230; and Travis is what I came up with.

Status quo


	Travis is currently running on http://travis.heroku.com and already notifies me about builds that pass or fail when someone pushes to those repositories I&#8217;ve registered for testing purposes.
	The builds run on a virtual server that Julian Fischer has very kindly granted for this experiment.

            Ok, when it came to unit tests I&#8217;ve been in the heavy-mocking-and-stubbing camp a few years ago. But then I&#8217;ve then seen our team (including myself) crash into the same issue over and over again: the fact that with mocks/stubs one does not test the real thing. One tests mocks and stubs which can easily get out of sync with the &#8220;real thing&#8221;, i.e. ActiveRecord models in our case.

So I&#8217;ve completely turned away from my previous position. Our tests became somewhat s...

We had the I18n gem tested on runcoderun, a great service for open source projects to run continous integration on the web, and this was working very well for us. Unfortunately runcoderun was taken down.

So I figured it should be easy to setup a few apps on Heroku and have them run the I18n test suite on...

            While Ripper parses your code it continously fires events (or &#8220;calls callbacks&#8221;) when it finds something interesting. There are two types of events: scanner (lexer) and parser events.

The scanner basically goes through the code from the left to the right character by character. When it finds known things (such as a keyword, whitespace or a semicolon) it fires a corresponding even that you can react to. The parser works on a higher level and watches for known Ruby constructs (such...

            So, the combination Ripper/Ripper2Ruby lets you do similar things as you can do with ParseTree or RubyParser and Ruby2Ruby. The differences are:


	Ripper requires Ruby 1.9 (I was told it possibly could be compiled to work with Ruby 1.8.x but I don&#8217;t know anything further. Please drop me a note if you know how to do this.)

I'll be giving a talk about "The future of I18n in Ruby on Rails" on RailsConf Europe next week together with Marko Seppae.

Am I excited about it? You bet! Will that be an interesting talk for everyone involved into Rails I18n? Of course, I'm sure :)

Also, there are some plans to also work on I18n/Rails during the Code Community Drive but I'm not sure what the status of this is right now.

The main translation method #translate which is used to lookup translations.
