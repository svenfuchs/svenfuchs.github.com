<p>Year! I'm in the middle of relocating to Berlin: we're going to pitch our camp <a href='http://maps.google.de/?q=Gr%C3%BCnberger+Stra%C3%9Fe+65,+10245+Friedrichshain,+Berlin&amp;sll=51.124213,10.546875&amp;sspn=8.637385,24.060059&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;om=1&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=addr'>right here</a>.</p><p>I've been living in the drop-dead gorgeous <a href='http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendland'>Wendland</a> (Lower Saxony, Germany) for the last 15 years now and I've greatly enjoyed it. But now the time has come that I'm goint to move to a large city again. There's a multitude of (mostly personal) reasons why we chose to move to Berlin, but I'm very excited about the plethora of additional opportunities re: development, design, networking etc. that I'll be able to dive into.</p><p>One big event that I'm particulary looking forward to is of course the <a href='http://www.railsconfeurope.com/'>RailsConf Europe</a> which is hosted in Berlin this year.</p><p>So that's all pretty exciting and thrilling! </p><p>If you're ever going to Berlin please drop me a note so we can meet and have a few beers or so. Also, I'm going to <a href='http://www.couchsurfing.com/mapsurf.html?SEARCH[skip]=0&amp;view=detail&amp;sid=d7947da16505dfed4046000f59907a33'>offer my couch</a> to nice people like you. So if you don't know where to stay in Berlin, just get in touch.</p><p>PS: Please forgive me if some of your comments on my blog have been waiting inconveniently long!</p><p>PPS: I've already changed my hCard/address on this blog to show my new address in Berlin. Actually, we're going to hit our new domicile on Monday next week. </p>
