<p>I really enjoyed putting this together with Liz. She even helped me to make the first version of the plugin even simpler and told me about the &#124;% ifchanged %} Liquid tag that I wasn't aware of.</p><p>Also, I was quite impressed how Liz - doing unusual things in Liquid - got Mephisto to do funky things that the software is rather not designed for. I initially called it a "hack" but meanwhile I think that's what's really called "thinking outside the box". :-) Anyways, this was both instructive and fun!</p><p>And it also sparked the idea for the following offer:</p><p><strong>Send me your Mephisto plugin requests!</strong></p><p>If you think there's something missing in Mephisto and it could be done as a plugin, just <a href='/svenfuchs' title='Sven Fuchs - artweb design'>drop me a note</a> (or post to the <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/MephistoBlog' title='Mephisto Blog |
  Google Groups'>Mephisto mailinglist</a>). If I agree that it's a feature that would make sense I might have a stab at implementing it.</p><p>Of course I don't want to waste time (mine and yours) with weird stuff and there might be a multitude reasons to reject a request. But if by any means it's a reasonable feature that I can implement without spending ages of time, I very well might just do it.</p><p>So, give it a try!</p><p>There are a couple of ways to contact me listed on my <a href='/svenfuchs'>about page</a>.</p>
