<p>Saimon Moore, one of the members of the Globalize developers team, came up with a Globalize plugin for Mephisto, "the best blogging system ever".  Reaction on the Mephisto mailinglist: <em>"Wow, this rocks really hard! Thanks, Thanks, Thanks! :)"</em></p><p><a href='http://www.webtypes.com/2007/03/18/globalizing-mephisto'><strong>Globalizing Mephisto</strong></a><br />
First part of a two-part series on Globalizing your Mephisto application.</p><p>Also, Saimon posted a series of articles about the new additions to Globalize on his blog recently:</p><p><a href='http://www.saimonmoore.net/2007/3/17/globalize-internal-storage-mechanism'><strong>The Internal Storage Mechanism For Globalize for Rails Model Translations</strong></a><br />

An article about Saimons latest addition to Globalize's features list. </p><p>Namespaced View Translations? What? This funny dialog from Saimon's article demonstrates nicely the kind of usecases that this feature is about:</p><p>Your boss phones you up and bellows: <em>"None of the site’s links are working in Slovenian?"</em><br />
[...]<br />
You: <em>"Jeez, don’t translators know you can’t use non-ascii characters in URLs?"</em><br />
Boss: <em>"Umm, well no. They’re translators. That’s your job."</em><br />
You: <em>"Ah, well, ok I’ll just give them a list of words that are urls and should be translated without accents."</em><br />
Boss: <em>"But we use the word ‘section’ in the view as well ..."</em><br />
You: <em>"ummm ... Let me think ..."</em> (time passes)<br />
Boss: <em>"Also we need the site in Greek which has a lot of strange characters. And come to think of it, this list of urls is getting pretty hard to maintain."</em><br />
You: <em>"Well, what we need is to be able to have two sorts of translation of the word ‘section’, one for the front end and one for the urls."</em></p><p>... and that's exactly where <a href='http://www.saimonmoore.net/2007/3/18/namespaced-view-translations'>Namespaced Viewtranslations</a> come in.</p>
