<p>Hey, just in case you missed this like I did: there&#8217;s a video of Saimon Moore&#8217;s conference session about Globalize at &#8221;<a href='http://ostrava.rails.cz/en' title='Ostrava on Rails - First Czech Ruby On Rails Conference'>Ostrava on Rails</a>&#8221; available online!</p>

<p>The video probably leaves something to be desired regarding the allover quality, but hey! At least you can now watch one of our star developers giving an introduction to Globalize on Rails and that&#8217;s pretty cool, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p>So, go and grab the video here: <a href='http://ostrava.rails.cz/video/oor_2007_saimon.avi'>Saimon Moore's conference session about Globalize</a>.</p>

<p>Like Saimon mentions this in his <a href='http://www.saimonmoore.net/2007/7/4/after-ostrava' title='After Ostrava - Simple thoughts'>conference roundup</a> there are also <a href='http://www.rails.cz/articles/2007/06/27/oor-videos' title='Rails.CZ : OOR videos'>videos of several other interesting sessions</a> available like those of Jamis Buck (about, guess what, deployment with Capistrano) and Tobias LÃ¼tke (about how he got shopify to where it is today).</p>
