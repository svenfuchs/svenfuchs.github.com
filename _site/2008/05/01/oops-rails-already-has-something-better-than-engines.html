<p>To check that out I've reassemled an application that I'm currently working on and that uses Engines to modularize things and added this line to config/environment.rb:</p><pre><code>
config.plugin_paths &lt;&lt; 'vendor/engines'
</code></pre><p>Now I have a working application with a directory layout like this:</p><pre><code>
vendor/
  engines/
    adva_blog/
      app/
        controllers/
        helpers/
        models/
        views/
      db/
        migrate/
      init.rb
      routes.rb
    adva_cms/
      ...
    adva_comments/
      ...
    adva_wiki/
      ...
  plugins/
    acts_as_list/
    acts_as_paranoid/
    ...
    will_paginate/
</code></pre><p>At the same time, the <code>app/</code> directory is almost empty, because this application is meant as a base or platform for custom applications. Obviously one could move the <code>vendor/engines/</code> folder somewhere else. Perhaps to <code>apps/</code> below the <code>app/</code> directory?. </p><p><strong>I totally love this!</strong></p><p>But, yeah. Of course this is not <strong>exactly</strong> the same like what John was talking about. He spoke of first-class sub-apps, i.e. something that's conceptually on the same level as the Rails "app" itself. With Engines those apps are just plugins. </p><p>"Just plugins" in Rails 2.0 means that they are actually very powerful. But there are also some traps with unexpected Depenendcies and class reloading issues that plugins in Rails do <strong>not</strong> live on the same level as the app. They seem to be meant as <strong>framework-level</strong> extensions, not <strong>application-level</strong> extensions.</p><p>If Rails would at some point compensate for that, probably by inventing the concept of a dedicated "application-level plugin" that behaves exactly the same way as the application itself does (i.e. reloads in dev mode), ... then John's vision finally would have become real.</p><p>Until then, though, I'm super happy to be able to store higher-level Engines separate from lower-level plugins :)</p><h2>Application-level plugins?</h2><p>The point is that when it comes to, e.g., using <code>ActiveRecord Observers</code> Rails Dependencies produces errors that can be pretty hard to track when models from plugins are involved. There are other several scenarios like this.</p><p>My solution to these issues so far is to put the following line into my plugin's init.rb file:</p><pre><code>
Dependencies.load_once_paths -= Dependencies.load_once_paths.select{|path| \
  path =~ %r(^#{File.dirname(__FILE__)}) }  
</code></pre><p>I haven't understood <code>Dependencies</code> well enough yet though to be sure if that's the best way to do have everything in a plugin be reloaded seemlessly with every request in dev mode. But so far it works quite well.</p><p>If you happen to know a better solution please let me know!</p><p>Maybe it would be a nice idea to wrap that sucker above into a method on <code>Engines::Plugin</code>. Something like: <code>reloadable!</code> and call that from the init.rb file instead.</p>
