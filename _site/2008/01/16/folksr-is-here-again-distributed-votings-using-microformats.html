      <h1>Folksr is here - again! Distributed votings using Microformats</h1>
      <h2>How folksr works</h2>

<p>In a nutshell: Folksr does what it tagline says - it allows you to get your opinion be heard louder and drive more attention to what you're saying. With folksr's votebacks you organize web-wide votings in a way that is both fun and useful.</p>

<p>Folksr does this by aggregating vote-links (a simple <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/vote-links" title="vote-links - Microformats">Microformat</a>) from the web. Basically:</p>

<ol>
<li>you publish a vote-link (that's just a plain HTML link with a tiny addition) anywhere on the internet and </li>
<li>tell folksr about it, folksr will go and look for your vote. If it finds it and recognizes the URL where you point to it adds your vote to a voting that is related to this URL.</li>
<li>You will then see your vote added to the voting results on folksr.de and can publish these results on your own site.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it. That easy and simple. For signing in folksr relies solely on OpenID (required only for adding a voting). So, folksr is all about open data and "the web as a plattform".</p>

<h2>How can I get you involved?</h2>

<p>With folksr, I am looking for your help. :)</p>

<p>I'd highly appreciate your feedback, suggestions, support ... and of course ... participation!</p>

<p><strong>I'd particulary like to ask you for suggestions and help to get some initial "real" votings going.</strong></p>

<p>What could possibly be done to motivate you to try folksr and publish a vote? What topics would be interesting enough? What else?</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Aside from real usage which is the most important thing for folksr to evolve now, the next important thing might be to further work on the presentation and interface design.</p>

<p>I feel folksr is way to text-laden and doesn't communicate its own purpose very well. I will continue to try to improve that. Suggestions are very welcome. Unfortunately, as a programmer, I am pretty much an all-fingers-thumbs moron when it comes to logos and other graphics. So I also very much appreciate every single bit of help here.</p>

<p>Also I plan to add the following features in the near future:</p>

<ul>
<li>plugins for some blog engines for pinging folksr about new votes when published (Chris Messina suggested the term "voteback" which I think is a perfect match, thanks Chris!)</li>
<li>a timemachinesque history to review past states of votings and charts to visualize a voting's history (initially suggested by Brian Suda)</li>
<li>tagging for votings (also suggested by Brian and others)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learn more ... and try it out!</h2>
