title: How to use the Bundled assets plugin with Rails' built-in tag helpers
---
<p>As Nick explains all you have to do to get this working is: use a slightly different route in your routes.rb than I've told you to do in my original article. Nick changed the route to:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
map.connect ":asset_dir/:names.:ext",
            :controller => "assets_bundle",
            :action => "fetch",
            :asset_dir => /(stylesheets|javascripts)/,
            :ext => /(css|js)/,
            :names => /[^.]*/
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this routes a request to an URL like <code>/stylesheets/main,content,forms.css</code> to the <code>AssetsBundleController#fetch</code> action ... while it preserves the stylesheets and javascripts directories - and that's where the built-in Rails helpers point by default.</p>

<p>This way, you now can use these neat, little helpers like so:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
&lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag 'main,content,forms' %>
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'common,forms' %>
</code></pre>

<p>... without bothering about any further details like HTML attributes that might be necessary here (and that I personally have to look up every time).</p>

<p>So, that's pretty cool. Thanks Nick! :-)</p>

<p>PS:</p>

<p>The same thing, but using Liquid template tags, would be:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">
{{ 'main,content,forms' | stylesheet }}
{{ 'common,forms' | javascript }}
</code></pre>

<p>Nice, too. Eh?</p>
