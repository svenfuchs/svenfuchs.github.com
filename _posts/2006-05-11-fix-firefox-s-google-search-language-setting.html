title: Fix Firefox's Google Search language setting
---
<p>Short note to myself. In case you've ever have to reinstall Firefox, immediately go and kill the line</p>

<pre>19 &lt;input name="meta" value="lr%3Dlang_de"></pre>

<p>in &lt;appdir>/firefox/searchplugins.</p>

<p>Do not wait. Just do it now. Quick!</p>

<p>I've been really annoyed by firefox's internal search plugin which - I can't remember since when -
send me to www.google.de kindly "tailoring" the search results for German users. That means:
practically ommitting every interesting page on the web.</p>

<p>As I'm usually looking for technical things this behaviour actually results in the opposite of
what Google wants to achive - I usually got totally useless results for almost everything.</p>
