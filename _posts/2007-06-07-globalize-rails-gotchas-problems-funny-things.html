<h2>I'm seeing lot's of strange characters!</h2>

<p>... also known as: what's with all these quotation marks?</p>

<p>While it'd probably be tempting to quote the classics "The sixties weren't good to you, were they?" (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0317219/quotes">Sarge, Cars</a>) the real I18n superhero knows that you actually have a problem with your character encoding here. What you need to do is get your entire application stack (Ruby, Rails, your database, webserver ...) talk utf-8.</p>

<p>Here are some resources that you might find useful:</p>

<h2>Weird Currency parsing results</h2>

<p>Beware that the Globalize Currency class is still somewhat biased when it comes to parsing numbers in that it will always use a dot "." as a decimal separator regardless of what's defined as the current Locale.</p>

<p>Also, there's a bug that causes Globalize to parse a String like "1.9" to a
Cents value of 109 Cents instead of 190 Cents like one would expect. So beware the results.</p>

<p>Both of these problems are fixed by this patch though (to the best of my knowledge this was first posted on the <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/70175">Rails I18n mailinglist
</a>):</p>

<pre><code>
Locale.set('en-US')
p Globalize::Currency.parse('1.90') # => #&lt;Globalize::Currency:0x3768078 @cents=190>
Locale.set('de-DE')
p Globalize::Currency.parse('1,90') # => #&lt;Globalize::Currency:0x3767f10 @cents=190>
</code></pre>


<h2>Globalize WrongLanguageError on attribute read</h2>

<p>When you encounter this error you're probably doing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>
p = Page.find(1) # returns an english page
Globalize::Locale.set 'fr-CH' # p is now the 'wrong' language
puts p.title # This throws WrongLanguageError.
</code></pre>

<p>This really should be:</p>

<pre><code>
Globalize::Locale.set 'fr-CH'
p = Page.find(1) # or: p.reload (if p is already there)
puts p.title
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you have <a href="http://opensvn.liquid-concept.com/trac/globalize_extension">Globalize extensions</a> installed, you can use the switch_language method:</p>

<pre><code>
@page.switch_language(base_language.code) { @page.title }
</code></pre>


<h2>Globalizes screws my RJS (or: my IE6)!</h2>

<p>Not really.</p>

<p>But probably you've followed the instructions from Chad Fowlers book "Rails Receipes" (page 268) and adopted the following piece of code:</p>

<pre><code>
after_filter :set_charset
  def set_charset
    unless @headers["Content-Type"] =~ /charset/i
      @headers["Content-Type"] ||= ""
      @headers["Content-Type"] += "; charset=utf-8"
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>With this you'll most probably end up delivering broken HTTP headers like this:</p>

<pre><code>Content-Type: ;charset=utf-8</code></pre>

<p>It has been reported that this successfully screws RJS and apparently
leaves <a href="http://www.nabble.com/FIXED-Internet-Explorer-cannot-download-pages-tf2716459s17045.html">IE 6.0 choking</a>, too.</p>

<p>You can easily get around this by changing the fourth line to:</p>

<pre><code>@headers["Content-Type"] ||= "text/html"</code></pre>

<p>Another, probably slightly better variant of the <code>set_charset</code> filter can be
found here: <a href="http://www.artweb-design.de/2006/12/03/some-common-questions-on-getting-started-get-on-rails-with-globalize-part-2-of-6">Some common questions on getting started - Get on Rails with Globalize! Part 2 of 6</a></p>

<h2>Others?</h2>

<p>Of course this list can't ever be complete. So, again: if you've found any other common gotchas concerning Globalize, please drop me a note!</p>
